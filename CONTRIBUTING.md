# How to Contribute

Thank you for taking the time to learn how to contribute!

Please start by reviewing our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure our community remains respectful and approachable. By participating, you will be expected to uphold this code.

## Questions

If you have a question, please check the [documentation](https://breakid.github.io/terminal_sync/) and search previous [Q&As](https://github.com/breakid/terminal_sync/discussions/categories/q-a) first. If you cannot find an answer, please post your question [here](https://github.com/breakid/terminal_sync/discussions/new?category=q-a) (i.e., create a new discussion under the **Q&A** category of the **Discussions** tab).

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Ghostwriter and its packages, which are hosted in the GhostManager Organization on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Basics of Contributing to the Project

The project team welcomes feedback, new ideas, and external contributions. The following sections provide details on specific types of contributions.

### Reporting an Issue/Bug

Before submitting an issue, please do the following:

1. Make sure you are using the latest release (check the version number in the `pyproject.toml` file)
2. Check open and closed issues for any related discussions

When submitting a new issue use the provided template. Please fill out the questions to ensure we have the basic information we need to review and reproduce the issue.

### Suggesting a Change or New Feature

Start by reviewing the [terminal_sync Roadmap](https://github.com/users/breakid/projects/1) under the **Projects** tab and the [Ideas](https://github.com/breakid/terminal_sync/discussions/categories/ideas) section under the **Discussions** tab. If your idea is already being discussed, feel free to comment on it to add your support.

Please submit new ideas [here](https://github.com/breakid/terminal_sync/discussions/new?category=ideas) (i.e., the **Ideas** section of the **Discussion** tab). Provide clear and concise answers to the following questions.

- What problem are you having or trying to solve?
- How do you measure success?
  - What is your desired outcome?
  - What would a successful solution look like?
- What alternatives have you considered or tried?
- What additional context is necessary to understand your request?

### Submitting a Pull Request

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain code quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Review the [Developer Guide](https://breakid.github.io/terminal_sync/developer_guide/) and follow the [Style Guide](https://breakid.github.io/terminal_sync/style_guide/)
2. Follow all instructions in the pull request template (coming soon)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

These prerequisites must be satisfied prior to your pull request being reviewed; however, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before accepting your pull request.
